Overview:
In Week 4, we explored advanced-level Java features that enhance code reusability, efficiency, and robustness. 
Topics included type-safe generic programming, the powerful Java Collections Framework, handling files and streams, managing exceptions effectively, leveraging regular expressions for pattern matching, writing unit tests using JUnit, and utilizing modern Java 8 features like lambda expressions and Stream API.

Topics Covered:
Day 1: Java Generics 
  - Introduction to Generics
  - Benefits of using Generics (type safety, code reusability)
  - Generic classes and methods
  - Bounded types and wildcards
  - Practical use cases of generics in Java

Day 2: Collections
 - Overview of Java Collections Framework
 - List, Set, and Map interfaces
 - ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap, TreeMap
 - Iterating through collections using Iterator and enhanced for loop
 - Collections utility methods (e.g., sort, reverse, shuffle)

Day 3: Java IO Streams
 - Byte vs Character streams
 - InputStream and OutputStream classes
 - FileInputStream, FileOutputStream
 - Reader and Writer classes (FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader)
 - Handling files and stream operations

Day 4: Exceptions
 - What are exceptions?
 - Difference between checked and unchecked exceptions
 - try-catch-finally block
 - Creating custom exceptions
 - Using throw and throws keywords

Day 5: Regex and JUnit
 - Introduction to Regular Expressions (Regex)
 - Common regex patterns and syntax
 - Using Pattern and Matcher classes
 - Introduction to Unit Testing with JUnit
 - Writing and running test cases
 - Assertions and test annotations

Day 6: Java 8 Features
- Introduction to Java 8
- Lambda expressions
- Functional interfaces (Predicate, Consumer, Function)
- Stream API and functional programming concepts
- Method references and default/static methods in interfaces

Prerequisites:
 - Understanding of Java basics, OOPs, and data structures
 - Completion of Week 1 through Week 3 topics
 - Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or later) installed IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code
